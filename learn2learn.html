        <h2>Set the Stage</h2>
        <p>To set the stage for myself, I minimized web browsers containing many tabs that I didn't want to get rid of just yet and, instead, opened a fresh web browser page that would contain tabs related only to what task I was about to work on. I then turned my desktop notifications off so that slack message banners would not distract me. (video uploaded in repo as "Desktop-Video-Recording.mov")</p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Currently, I have been learning Javascript. I had some knowledge of the topic having taken the Javascript Accelerated course, but the drills were still difficult. I was able to figure out the objectives of the drills and small pieces of the code fairly easily, but struggled mostly with determining how to put together those pieces of code to get the correct result. I drew input/output tables and wrote down, in words, what I was trying to accomplish with each drill. To move past my pain points with the drills, I first tried code that I could recall off the top of my head. If that didn't work, then I googled how to write code for parts of the function. Finally, I asked students and/or instructors for guidance when I was really stuck.</p>
        <p>Though the drills took a long time, I learned new, interesting JS methods along the way that could be useful in the future and I enjoy the struggle! I look forward to learning more applications of JS functions and diving further into for and while loops. I generally like to figure things out on my own and avoid asking for help. I need to work on setting a time limit for struggling with a problem and recognizing when I'm stuck (aka entering the zone of proximal development) so I can ask for guidance sooner. Setting the stage at the beginning of my work period, however, allowed me to keep track of what code I had executed and stay headed in the right direction, rather than getting distracted and forgetting where I left off.</p>

        <h2>Set the Stage</h2>
        <p>To set the stage for myself, I (1) minimized web browsers, Atom, and Slack, (2) quit out of my two open terminals that I was no longer using, and (3) opened a new terminal and a fresh web browser page that would contain tabs related only to what task I was about to work on. (video uploaded in repo as "Desktop-Recording.mov")</p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I spent the majority of the day working on the third "Build Multi-Page Websites" drill and, specifically, incorporating grid into my website CSS page. I skipped breakout sessions for grid earlier in the course so I relied on articles and previously recorded breakouts to learn grid. I struggled to learn and apply grid to my website for about half an hour and, since this was not an official school day and I did not have access to instructor help, I decided to stop attempting grid and switched to flex box.</p>
        <p>Setting the stage at the beginning allowed me to focus on one task at a time and was not the cause of my inability to grasp grid concepts on my own. Though I was able to complete all of the website drills without using grid, it would be advantageous for me to spend a little bit of time with an instructor or other student to grasp the basic concepts of grid since grid could be more useful for certain page layouts than flex.</p>

        <h2>Set the Stage</h2>
        <p>To set the stage for myself, I (1) minimized my terminal, Slack, and my web browser full of tabs, (2) turned off my notifications, and (3) opened a new terminal and a fresh web browser page that would contain tabs related only to what task I was about to work on.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Most of my morning was spent at the "Intro to DOM" breakout, and my afternoon involved me writing code for my final Project 1. Specifically, I was trying to research how to insert background images to my web pages and style them to lay behind my text on the pages. I struggled figuring out how to properly search this so I could get the answers I was looking for. Once I found relevant search results, I realized that I may be overcomplicating my project and may want to reserve more detailed features for future projects.</p>
        <p>Turning off my notifications has greatly improved my ability to focus on the task at hand and accomplish my goals. Though I spent a good chunk of time trying to format my background image to only end up not using that method, I learned some other neat features of CSS such as the z index. For now, I will keep my first project relatively simplistic, but I hope to play around with advanced CSS features on my own time to learn more about the possibilities of web design.</p>
