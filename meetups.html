        <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
        <p>February 12, 2018</p>
        <p>Learn to Code: Social Session</p>

        <h2>People I Met</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Alex Baker, Beatport, Software Engineer</li>
          <li>Nona Drake, ADP, Architect & Developer</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Learn to Learn value preached at Galvanize is relevant to all developers throughout their entire careers. Everyone is constantly researching things about the language they work with, and adapting to new languages.</li>
          <li>Feel comfortable with not knowing everything about a language because no one does. All developers experience some sort of discomfort and struggle at some point in their careers, so they are understanding and supportive of learning curves. My best friends will be Google, coworkers, and professional connections while coding.</li>
          <li>Be personable and able to communicate well because determination and culture fit matter more in the real world than having the strongest technical skills.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions I Have</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Nona highly recommended going deep in one language (CSS, HTML, back end, etc.) rather than having a general knowledge of many languages. Do I want to focus most of my attention on either front end or back end, or get a general understanding of both?</li>
          <li>So far, I enjoy javascript and CSS. What other languages are similar, or would be useful to use in conjunction with javascript and CSS?</li>
          <li>At a basic level, what do I want out of my career?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
        <p>February 13, 2018</p>
        <p>February Develop Happy Hour</p>

        <h2>People I Met</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Alexander Seplowe, Charles Schwab, Associate Software Engineer</li>
          <li>Rachel Doren, SpotX, Technical Operations Engineer</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The tech industry consists of people from a wide variety of personal and professional backgrounds, and many people are self taught. This is encouraging since these people have experienced and continue to experience the same struggles that I will encounter, and they can serve as a support system throughout my career.</li>
          <li>It's important to sharpen communication and teamwork skills now to work most effectively and to help avoid misunderstandings in the future.</li>
          <li>Discrimination is still very prevalent in the tech community so it's crucial that I stick up for myself if I want my ideas heard, to be respected, and to move up in my career.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions I Have</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>How can I apply the skills I gained from my previous professional experience to my future career as a developer?</li>
          <li>How can I connect more with other females in the tech community and prepare myself for the challenges that the real world will present to me post Galvanize?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
        <p>February 20, 2018</p>
        <p>Lady Coders: Negotiate Like A Boss</p>

        <h2>People I Met</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Courtney Fay, Unemployed, General Assembly Alumni</li>
          <li>Erin Porter, Unemployed, General Assembly Student</li>
          <li>Lia James, humanpredictions, Training + Development/Growth + Strategy</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is important that I determine what benefits matter most to me, what I want from my employer to achieve the best work/life balance, and to clearly and confidently express what I want as an employee.</li>
          <li>I need to change my mindset regarding salary negotiations. Being able to discuss my salary with my employer will establish a respectable relationship while demonstrating my self-confidence and maturity.</li>
          <li>Don't feel pressured to disclose specific salary expectations unless the value is severely less than expected. I was not aware that I did not need to put down a value during the application and interview process, but avoiding a number can prevent the employer from undervaluing my worth.</li>
          <li>Ask for clarification about job offer packages. There may be vague and/or misleading benefits listed on the initial offer that would be much more difficult to negotiate after signing your contract.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions I Have</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>How can I determine and continue to reevaluate my monetary value throughout my career as I gain more professional experience and technical skills?</li>
          <li>How else can I sharpen my soft skills?</li>
          <li>What benefits do I value most?</li>
        </ul>
