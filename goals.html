        <h2>Goals for the day:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Write goals for the day and set schedule for tomorrow.</li>
          <li>Read through first 3 articles on Bucket 1 "Build multi-page websites" drills.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Progress at the end of the day:</h2>
        <p>Three of my version control drills were sent back to me in the morning after setting these goals. Because of this, I was unable to read through all three articles (goal 2) and spent the afternoon revising my drills instead. I was, however, able to get through some of the first article (HTML), I set goals, and I learned how to properly submit items to GitHub.</p>
        <p>To achieve my goals in the future, I need to prioritize my time better. Specifically in this situation, I should have put myself in the queue to get help instead of trying to fix the issue on my own for hours. Spending an excessive amount of time on something that I was unable to resolve on my own in the end prevented me from moving forward with other objectives and could hinder my learning in the future. What has worked for me in the past is to block off sections of the day that are dedicated to specific tasks. Though I did learn something by the end of the day and will eventually achieve the original goals, reprioritizing my goals mid day wasn't an effective method for achieving my goals in a timely manner. Moving forward, I will stick to my schedule set at the beginning of the day and will set some goals at the end of the day for the following day.</p>

        <h2>Goals for the day:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Finish "Attend Meetups" drills 2 and 3.</li>
          <li>Read articles for "Publish Websites" drills.</li>
          <li>Finish "Publish Websites" drill 1.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Progress at the end of the day:</h2>
        <p>I was able to accomplish all goals, and more! In the morning, I submitted my "Attend Meetups" drills, and in the afternoon, I read through the "Publish Websites" drills and submitted all three "Publish Websites" drills instead of just the first drill.</p>
        <p>Though I accomplished my goals, I overestimated how long these tasks would take me. This is ok for making myself feel good and successful, but, in the future, I should push myself to achieve more. If I suspect early on in the day that I will achieve goals much sooner than expected, then I can set additional goals mid day. It's not always possible to determine how long certain tasks will take to complete but I will get a better sense of realistic goals for myself as I play around with what and how much I want to tackle each day.</p>

        <h2>Goals for the day:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Save repl.it drills still sitting on webpage browsers.</li>
          <li>Attend "Intro to DOM" breakout.</li>
          <li>Write out HTML for Project 1.</li>
          <li>Write "About Me" section for Project 1.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Progress at the end of the day:</h2>
        <p>I was able to complete the first three goals on my list. It was important to me to remove the repl.it tabs on my browser because they were getting distracting after having been there for weeks but also contained information that I wished to keep. The breakout was good for me because I had no idea what the DOM was and it will be crucial for me to understand once I begin Unit 2. I was unable to complete the fourth goal because I spent my time styling my project instead of writing the content.</p>
        <p>To achieve each of the goals in the future, I need to reflect on my goals throughout the day and catch myself getting off track more quickly. Implementing some sort of reminder system for myself may discipline me stay on track and take breaks more frequently.</p>
